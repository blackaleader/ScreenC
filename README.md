# ScreenC ðŸ“¸

Screen Cloud is a solution crafted to address challenges faced by Iranian users experiencing difficulties in sending media content on platforms with filtered or restricted CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), such as Discord. This project leverages Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to empower users to upload their content seamlessly, bypassing the need for VPNs or third-party services.

## Key Features

- **Effortless Uploads:** Easily upload media content to Amazon S3 without the reliance on VPNs or external services.

- **CDN Bypass:** Bypasses any type of CDN restrictions on a wide range of platforms, ensuring a smooth media sharing experience.

- **Secure Storage:** Utilizes the security and reliability of Amazon S3 for storing uploaded content.

## How It Works

1. Users take their own screenshot using the built-in GUI app. 

2. The uploader securely transfers their taken PNG to Amazon S3.

3. The URL belonging to the taken Screenshot will be replaced instead of a PNG in the clipboard.

4. Share the link on platforms with restricted CDNs, enabling others to access the media seamlessly.
